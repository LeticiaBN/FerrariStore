### Project Description

Describe how your project implements the functionality in the requirements. Diagrams can help a lot here.

The Ferrari Store is an online store for selling collectible items, offering a curated selection of miniature cars and helmets. A must-visit for motorsport enthusiasts, it provides high-quality replicas of Ferrari cars and iconic racing helmets, perfect for collectors and fans alike.

### Requirements

The requirements are given in the assignment, but you have to add any new requirements needed by your particular store implementation.

### Comments about the code

Any comment you may want to add to help understand your code. This is good programming practice.

### Test Plan

Text describing the tests that will be performed. If an automatic test tool/framework is used (ex: Selenium, JUnit, Spock), the code for the tests can be used

### Test Results

Text describing the test results. If an automatic test tool/framework is used, its output can be used.
For instance, for testing, you may say I intend to use the postman to test the back end, etc.

### Build Procedures

A step-by-step guide to run your code. You should start telling how to install whatever software you need, then how to download/build your program, and finally how to set up the environment to run it. Imagine that someone installing will just follow these commands (nothing more).

### Problems
